0BjBp3wasTg,Man City,EXTENDED HIGHLIGHTS | Man City 1-2 Man United | Manchester Derby defeat!,"City were narrowly beaten by two late goals by Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium.

Pep Guardiola’s side were heading for victory when Josko Gvardiol headed the Blues ahead from Kevin De Bruyne’s cross just after the half-hour mark.

Phil Foden, returning to the side after illness, almost doubled our lead with a low shot that was tipped just wide.

United levelled in the 88th minute when Amad Diallo was caught in the box by Matheus Nunes, and Bruno Fernandes scored from the penalty spot.

And the winger squeezed in a winner in the dying moments as the visitors took all three points.

City's FA Cup clash with Salford to be broadcast live
In a Selhurst Park clash played out amidst appalling weather thanks to Storm Darragh, Palace went ahead through Daniel Munoz early in the first half and Maxence Lacroix after the restart.

However, City – who also hit the post through Ilkay Gundogan and largely dominated territory and possession – deservedly hit back through first Haaland and then Lewis.

An incident-packed South London encounter then saw Lewis sent off late on for a second bookable offence.

City took an early lead as Bernardo helped on a KDB header, as the Blues maintained control and completed a dominant victory with goals from a returning KDB and Doku in the second half.

A much more cohesive second-display saw City grow into the game, but the failure to create any clearcut opportunities was eventually punished by a Mo Salah penalty on 78 minutes.

x5RaGMk68-8,Man City,"HIGHLIGHTS | Man City 3-3 Feyenoord | Haaland (2), Gundogan, Hadj-Moussa, Gimenez, Hancko Goals","City manager Pep Guardiola said the manner of a dramatic 3-3 Champions League draw at home to Feyenoord was ‘a difficult one to swallow’.

Manchester City lost a three-goal advantage as we were held to a 3-3 draw by Feyenoord in the Champions League.

Erling Haaland struck twice, his first making him the fastest player to 50 goal involvements in Champions League history when he scored from the penalty spot just before the break in just his 44th appearance in the competition.

They came either side of Ilkay Gundogan’s volley for his first goal back at the Etihad Stadium since returning in the summer.

But the Dutch side scored three times in the final 15 minutes through Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Gimenez and David Hancko to grab a point.

zODi_uDzfjk,Arsenal,HIGHLIGHTS | Liverpool vs Arsenal (0-1) | WSL | Russo with the winner!,"We made it seven straight victories in all competitions with a narrow win on the road against Liverpool. 

A first-half goal for Alessia Russo, in red-hot form, was enough to take the three points back home to north London in our penultimate fixture of 2024. 

Our Gunners lined up looking for four wins on the bounce in the WSL with five changes to the starting XI that beat Valerenga in our midweek UEFA Women's Champions League tie. 

With just two days to prepare for the trip to Liverpool, there were a few early signs of fatigue as the hosts burst out of the gate with intensity. We weathered the early storm of pressure and settled into a more comfortable rhythm.

Kyra Cooney-Cross, bringing composure and vision in midfield, switched play with a perfect cross-field pass to Beth Mead but the opportunity came to nothing. 

It wouldn't take long for us to find a breakthrough, however, as Alessia Russo put us ahead with her fifth consecutive goal in the Women’s Super League. Katie McCabe drilled a low corner to the near post and the ball snuck through all the way to our number 23. 

Some slick passing earned us a penalty shortly after as Gemma Bonner’s loose leg tripped Russo in the box. Mariona Caldentey stepped up to take the spot kick but was cruelly denied by the inside of the post.

Undeterred and looking to build on our lead, we continued to dominate the Liverpool final third and Russo came close to a brace, missing a header by a hair’s breadth.

As the half-time whistle drew closer, the Reds upped the intensity once more as they fought for a way back into the tie. Katie McCabe's headed clearance came close to trickling into her own net, but the danger was averted by Daphne van Domselaar. 

Back out for the second half and looking to consolidate the lead, captain Kim Little was introduced from the bench and brought her characteristic skill to the fray. 

Some fine defensive work from Leah Williamson started a counter-attack early on in the second half. Russo held the ball up well and her cutback to Frida Maanum was unfortunately struck over the bar.

A series of corners in quick succession provided opportunities to test Teagan Micah in the Liverpool goal, but both McCabe and Williamson's efforts were unsuccessful. 

With our narrow lead continuing into the final ten minutes, the match tightened up but our squad stood firm to secure the victory. 

TEAM NEWS
Arsenal starting XI: Van Domselaar, Fox, Williamson (C), Catley, Mariona (Wubben-Moy, 90), Mead (Blackstenius, 58), McCabe, Maanum (Little, 58), Foord (Hurtig, 76), Russo, Cooney-Cross

LVeg8ocuZiQ,Arsenal,HIGHLIGHTS | Arsenal vs Everton (0-0) | Premier League,"We were held to a goalless draw as we endured a frustrating afternoon at Emirates Stadium.

Despite dominating in terms of possession and chances created, we could not break down a resolute Everton rearguard.

Martin Odegaard had our best chances in the first half, while Bukayo Saka came closest after the break, but his volley was well saved.

So in the end we had to settle for a second consecutive draw in the Premier League.

Everton had the first sight of goal. Inside five minutes they won the ball high up the pitch and launched a counter attack with William Saliba caught out of position. Abdoulaye Doucoure got on the end of it, but was denied by a sliding Gabriel block as he pulled the trigger.

Aside from that though, nearly all of the opening 30 minutes was played in the Everton half. A Mikel Merino cross bounced just in front of Odegaard as he lined up his shot inside the area, but he couldn’t keep his effort down.

The skipper was a bit closer with his next effort, skipping past his man outside the area, before dragging his shot just wide with his favoured left foot.

With Odegaard’s next attempt, he hit the target but was denied by the sprawling Jordan Pickford. It came at the end of the best move of the half. Kai Havertz threaded a pass through to Saka, who wrong footed two defenders before picking out Odegaard near the penalty spot. Our No. 8 composed himself with bodies in front of him, but Pickford denied him.

Despite dominating in terms of possession, we were finding the Everton side tough to play through. Most of our attacks were funnelled down the wings, and Pickford was claiming all crosses coming his way.

Gabriel Martinelli did get in behind the defence though, after a quick pass through the middle from Declan Rice found Havertz ahead of him. He shifted the ball on to the scampering Martinelli, but his shot from a narrow angle was blocked by the keeper.

We came out for the second half looking to raise the intensity, and Saka drew a smart save from Pickford in the opening minute. A loose defensive header fell nicely for his first-time volley, but the England stopper got down well at the foot of the post. From the resulting corner Merino headed straight at Pickford.

We kept pressing. Havertz got the ball caught under his feet inside the area before he teed up Saka who had his drive charged down. Saka then had a cross-shot blocked from inside the area as we sought the breakthrough.

On the hour mark Mikel Arteta changed two thirds of his midfield – he sent on Ethan Nwaneri and Jorginho in place of Declan Rice and Odegaard.

Gabriel Jesus, Thomas Partey and Leandro Trossard were all summoned as well from the bench, to add to our attacking options on the pitch.

A late Saka corner caused confusion in the box but Saliba’s couldn’t get enough on it when the ball dropped to him. 

Partey had a penalty appeal turned down in injury-time, on a day of utter frustration in north London.

USTnc6eiwec,Arsenal,"HIGHLIGHTS | Arsenal vs AS Monaco (3-0) | Champions League | Saka scores, Lewis-Skelly impresses!","Bukayo Saka scored twice and Kai Havertz added a late third to beat Monaco and take us one step closer to booking our place in the last 16 of the Champions League next spring.

The winger netted a goal in each half to beat the Ligue 1 side, tapping home Gabriel Jesus’ centre on 34 minutes before accepting an early Christmas present from visiting goalkeeper Radoslaw Majecki 12 minutes from time to avoid a nervy conclusion.

The victory sees us move to 13 points and into third in the standings, with one more win from our final two games almost certainly enough to see us finish in the top eight and skip the play-off round in February.

Both teams went into this contest level on 10 points, and knowing a win would see them plant one foot in the last 16, neither was prepared to show their hand early on.

The opening 25 minutes was a cagey affair with little goalmouth action. Gabriel Jesus poked an effort straight at Radoslaw Majecki in the Monaco goal, Aleksandr Golovin failed to hit the target from the edge of the area and Martin Odegaard saw a pair of similar shots suffer the same fate as both sides traded jabs.

But we began to turn the screw and soon created two huge opportunities for Jesus within the space of three minutes. Firstly, a long Jakub Kiwior ball allowed Jesus to beat the offside trap and go through on goal, but after steadying himself, he scuffed his shot and Majecki’s boot diverted it away.

Our no. 9 had little time to dwell on that miss when he again found himself racing goalwards. This time he did great to hold off Thilo Kehrer to get a shot off, but the Monaco keeper stuck out a big hand to get enough on the ball and stop it creeping over his goalline.

The pressure, and atmosphere, was building, and on 33 minutes the breakthrough finally arrived - in part thanks to someone starting their first Champions League game.

Myles Lewis-Skelly became the youngest player to start for us in the competition since Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2011, but he showed a wise head to create our opener. Picking the ball up 40 yards out, he turned past Maghnes Akliouche and pushed forward before threading a perfect pass into Jesus. The Brazilian looked up and played the ball across goal to the back post where Saka completed a move started and finished in Hale End.

That would separate the teams at the half, what was incredible was that we only held a one-goal advantage as two more golden chances went begging before the break.

Odegaard latched upon a loose pass on halfway by Soungotou Magassa and breezed past Kehrer to allow him 40 yards to tuck the ball past Majecki, but he dragged his effort agonisingly wide of the far post. Soon after, Gabriel Martinelli did the same after our skipper forced a high turnover; and while the offside flag did go up, replays showed VAR could have intervened in our favour.

We had dominated the first 45, but Monaco began the second half looking more like a side who had won three of their last five Champions League fixtures.

Just a minute after the restart we got an indication of how costly our missed opportunities could be as Kehrer powered a header just wide to get nerves jangling, and on 63 minutes they came even closer when some sloppy play inside our half allowed Takumi Minamino to find Breel Embolo inside the box whose shot on the turn rippled the side netting.

But with 13 minutes to go, we managed to kill the game off thanks to a huge blunder by the French giants’ defence. Kehrer and Mohammed Salisu attempted to play out from the back inside their own box and fed the ball back to Majecki who under pressure from Havertz, passed straight to Saka who had the simple task of completing his brace.

That lifted the pressure with Monaco knowing the game was up, and the final stages were a procession that saw us add to our tally.

Mikel Merino saw a shot blocked before Saka’s eyes lit up at the chance of a hat-trick, but his effort was neatly nudged into the net by Havertz to give the scoreline a more flattering, but deserved, feel and see us stretch our unbeaten Champions League run at Emirates Stadium to eight matches.

8e_Uzi58hQc,Arsenal,"THREE BIG POINTS! | HIGHLIGHTS | Arsenal vs Manchester United (2-0) | Timber, Saliba | PL","The 500th competitive men’s game at Emirates Stadium was one to remember as goals from Jurrien Timber and William Saliba saw us clinch a fourth straight win over Manchester United for the first time ever.

Set pieces did the damage yet again, with Jurrien Timber turning in a Declan Rice delivery eight minutes after half-time to register his first goal for the club, and then on 73 minutes his fellow defender Saliba saw the ball cannon in off him in fortuitous circumstances to double the lead.

Importantly, the result saw us cut the gap at the top of the table to seven points, as our momentum continues to snowball at just the right time with four victories in a row clinched since the international break.

tJ85t5wi5qc,Arsenal,"HIGHLIGHTS | West Ham vs Arsenal (2-5) | Premier League | Gabriel, Trossard, Odegaard, Havertz, Saka","We blew away West Ham at the London Stadium, with all of our goals coming in a remarkable opening half.

Gabriel got it all started in the 10th minute, with a header from a corner, before Leandro Trossard tapped in our second. Bukayo Saka was brought down inside the area for Martin Odegaard to score from the penalty spot and Kai Havertz raced onto a Trossard pass to make it 4-0 with 10 minutes of the first half remaining.

West Ham mustered a comeback with a quickfire double. Aaron Wan-Bissaka scored inside the area and Emerson curled home a free-kick.

We were awarded a second penalty in first-half stoppage time, this time scored by Saka, and that settled us down again, allowing us to see out the win in the second-half.
